# Hierarchical-Routing-Network-Simulation
Hierarchical Routing Network Simulation

## Description
This project simulates a hierarchical router-based network design using Cisco Packet Tracer. It features a centralized core router (Router 6) that acts as the backbone, connecting multiple branch routers in a star-like topology. The design is suitable for large organizations or service providers managing multiple distributed locations.

### Features
Core Router Backbone:
Router 6 serves as the primary hub, interconnecting all branch routers for efficient data transmission.
Branch Routers:
Multiple routers are connected to the core, each representing different network segments or regional offices.
Scalability:
The network is designed for easy addition of new branches by connecting to the core router.
Routing Protocols:
Dynamic routing protocols can be configured to automate path selection and ensure optimal routing.
Connectivity Validation:
Ping tests performed successfully between routers to verify interconnectivity.

#### Purpose
To demonstrate a scalable hierarchical network design.
To simulate a real-world scenario where a core router manages data traffic for distributed branches.
To provide a platform for learning advanced routing concepts, including hierarchical routing and network optimization.

#### How to Use
Open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
Observe the hierarchical arrangement of routers.
Configure dynamic or static routing protocols as needed.
Use the simulation tools to send packets between routers and analyze data flow.

#### Network Details
Core Router:
Router 6 acts as the backbone of the network.
Branch Routers:
Each router connects to the core and represents a branch office or regional subnet.
IP Addressing:
Each branch is assigned a unique subnet for network segmentation.
Routing:
Dynamic routing (e.g., OSPF or EIGRP) or static routing can be implemented to optimize data paths.

#### Skills Demonstrated
Hierarchical network design.
Advanced routing protocol configuration.
Backbone network design for large-scale networks.
Connectivity testing and troubleshooting.

##### Future Improvements
Add redundancy by introducing backup core routers (e.g., using HSRP or VRRP).
Implement load balancing to distribute traffic evenly across links.
Introduce VLANs and access control for improved security and traffic management.

##### Prerequisites
Cisco Packet Tracer installed.
Understanding of routing protocols and subnetting.
